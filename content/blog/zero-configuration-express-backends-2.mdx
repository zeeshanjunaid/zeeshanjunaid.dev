Vercel now lets you run Express.js backends without any custom configuration. Drop an `express.js` file into your project, deploy, and get a working API route. This change cuts out boilerplate and setup for small APIs in React or Next.js apps. ## Why It Matters - **Faster API development:** No need for serverless adapters or custom build steps. Just write Express code. - **Fits React/Next.js stacks:** Useful for teams already using Vercel for frontend hosting. - **DX improvement:** Reduces friction for frontend devs who need quick backend endpoints. - **Deployment:** No special config, no extra files. Works out of the box. - **Who should care:** Frontend engineers, DX owners, anyone building prototypes or small APIs alongside their UI code. ## Background Vercel’s new feature detects an `express.js` file at the root of your project. If present, Vercel deploys it as an API backend—no `vercel.json` tweaks needed. Before this, running Express on Vercel meant using custom serverless handlers or third-party adapters. That added complexity and broke the zero-config promise. This update removes those steps. You get a familiar Express environment with no extra glue code. There are no breaking changes if you don’t use this feature; existing deployments stay the same. Migration is only needed if you want to switch from custom handlers to this new pattern. ## Minimal Example: Hello World API with Express Create a file called `express.js` at your project root: ```js
// express.js (at project root)
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy to Vercel as usual (`vercel deploy`). Visit `/api/hello` on your deployed site. You’ll see `{ "message": "Hello from Express!" }`. No flags or config files are needed. Vercel auto-detects `express.js`. ## Key API Usage: End-to-End Example Add another route: ```js
// express.js (continued)
app.post('/api/echo', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  res.json({ youSent: req.body });
});
``` Send a POST request to `/api/echo` with JSON body `{ "foo": "bar" }`. The response will echo it back: `{ "youSent": { "foo": "bar" } }`. ## How It Works (Flow Diagram) ```mermaid

    B -->|No| E[Fallback to default routing]
``` ## Pitfalls and Edge Cases - **File location:** Only works if `express.js` is at the project root. Other locations aren’t supported yet. - **Route mounting:** All routes must be mounted under `/api/*`. Non-API routes may not work as expected. - **SSR/Edge quirks:** Not documented yet if this integrates with SSR or Edge Middleware in Next.js. - **Static assets:** Don’t serve static files from Express; let Vercel handle static assets separately. - **Performance:** Running everything through Express may add cold starts or latency compared to pure serverless functions. Measure before switching production workloads. ## Checklist Before Shipping Zero-Config Express Backends on Vercel 1. Measure before/after performance (Web Vitals, latency). 2. Ship a tiny demo page that calls your new API route. 3. Add monitoring and alerting for new endpoints. 4. Plan a rollback path in case of regressions (keep old handler code handy). 5. Share learnings and gotchas internally with your team.
