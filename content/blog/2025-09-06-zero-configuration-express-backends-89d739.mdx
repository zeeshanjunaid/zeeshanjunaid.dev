Zero-configuration Express.js backends are now available on Vercel. You can deploy Express endpoints without any extra config or build steps. This matters for teams shipping custom APIs alongside React/Next.js apps. ### Why it matters You can add backend logic with almost no friction. There’s no `vercel.json` or custom server setup. Deploying an endpoint is as simple as writing a file. This reduces boilerplate and speeds up iteration for frontend-heavy teams. Express is a familiar API for many JavaScript developers. Now you can use it in the same repo as your frontend, without learning new patterns or frameworks. This fits best for:

> Note (replace me): Add a 2–3 line example from your own work or a small repo link.

- Next.js and React teams who need server-side logic (auth, proxies, custom API routes). - DX owners who want fast local iteration and simple deployment. - Performance champions who want to measure backend latency in the same stack. ### Background Vercel’s new feature lets you drop an `express.js` file into your project’s `/api` directory. Vercel detects this and spins up an Express backend automatically at deploy time. Before this change, you needed to configure custom servers or use Vercel’s built-in API routes (which have their own runtime quirks). Now, you get a real Express app without extra flags or adapters. There are no breaking changes for existing projects. You don’t need to migrate unless you want to use Express directly. Existing API routes keep working as before. ### Minimal Example: Add an Express Route Create `/api/express.js` in your project root: ```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy to Vercel. The endpoint will be available at `/api/express/hello`. No config files needed. No build step changes. ### How to Enable (No Flags Needed) Just add an `express.js` file under `/api`. Vercel auto-detects it at deploy time. No need to edit `vercel.json` or set environment variables. #### End-to-End Example: Custom Auth Middleware Add `/api/express.js`: ```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Simple auth middleware example
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers['x-api-key'] !== 'secret') {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  next();
});

app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ user: 'test-user' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy this. Now, `GET /api/express/profile` returns profile data only if the correct header is sent. ### Flow Diagram Idea (Mermaid) ```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Request to /api/express/*] --> B{Vercel detects express.js};
    B -- Yes --> C[Spin up Express app];
    C --> D[Handle route via Express];
    D --> E[Send response];
    B -- No --> F[Fallback to default API handler];
``` ### Pitfalls and Edge Cases
- Don’t mix old-style API routes and Express routes in the same path segment; they may conflict. - SSR (Server-side rendering) and Edge Functions don’t use this Express backend—keep them separate. - Static exports won’t include Express endpoints; they only work on Vercel’s serverless platform. - Watch cold starts: first request may be slower than subsequent ones due to function spin-up. - Not all Node modules may be supported; check [Vercel docs](https://vercel.com/docs) for current runtime limits (not documented yet for this feature). ### Checklist Before Shipping Zero-Config Express Backends
1. Measure before/after performance with Web Vitals or custom traces. 2. Ship a tiny demo page that hits your new endpoint (`/api/express/hello`). 3. Add monitoring and alerting for errors and latency spikes. 4. Plan a rollback path—keep old API routes until you’re sure migration works. 5. Share learnings with your team so others avoid common missteps.
