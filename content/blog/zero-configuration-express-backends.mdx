Vercel now runs Express.js backends with zero configuration. Drop an `express.js` file in your project. Deploy. No custom build steps, no serverless wrappers, no config files. Why it matters: - You can add dynamic API endpoints to React/Next.js projects without extra setup. - It removes friction for teams prototyping or scaling small APIs. - Frontend devs don’t need to learn new deployment patterns. - Useful for DX owners and performance leads who want to simplify stacks. ## What changed Before: To run an Express backend on Vercel, you had to wrap Express in a serverless handler or use custom server logic. This required extra files, boilerplate, and sometimes workarounds for cold starts or routing quirks. Now: Vercel detects an `express.js` file at the project root (or in `/api`). It deploys that file as an always-on backend—no config needed. You get standard Express APIs out of the box. There are no documented breaking changes. Existing setups using custom servers aren’t affected unless you opt in to this pattern. ## Minimal starter example Create a file called `express.js` at your project root: ```js
// express.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy to Vercel. The `/api/hello` route responds with JSON. No other config needed. ## How to enable 1. Add `express.js` to your repo root or `/api` folder. 2. Use standard Express syntax—no wrappers or special exports. 3. Deploy as usual (`vercel deploy`). 4. Vercel auto-detects and serves the backend. No feature flags or settings are required as of the announcement ([source](https://vercel.com/changelog/zero-configuration-express-backends)). ## Example: End-to-end usage with Next.js frontend Suppose you have a Next.js app in `/pages`. Add `express.js` as above. In your React component: ```js
// pages/index.js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
export default function Home() {
  const [msg, setMsg] = useState('');
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/hello')
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(d => setMsg(d.message));
  }, []);
  return <div>{msg}</div>;
}
``` This fetches from the Express backend route at `/api/hello` and displays the result. ## Flow diagram idea (Mermaid) ```mermaid

``` ## Pitfalls and edge cases - **Misplacing `express.js`:** If not at project root or `/api`, Vercel won’t detect it. - **SSR vs API:** Don’t mix SSR logic in `express.js`; keep frontend rendering in Next.js pages. - **Static assets:** Serve static files via Next.js/public, not through Express; otherwise, caching may break. - **Performance:** Always-on backends may cost more than serverless for low-traffic APIs; monitor cold starts if any (not documented yet). - **Middleware:** Use only supported Express middleware; custom binaries or native modules may not work (not documented yet). ## Checklist before rollout 1. Measure Web Vitals before and after enabling Express backend. 2. Ship a demo page that exercises each API route end-to-end. 3. Add monitoring/alerting for backend errors and latency spikes. 4. Plan a rollback path to previous serverless or custom-server approach if issues arise. 5. Share findings and gotchas with your team after first deployment. ## Further reading
