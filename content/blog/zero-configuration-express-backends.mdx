Vercel now runs Express backends without extra configuration. Drop an Express app into your project—no `vercel.json` or custom server setup needed. This change matters for frontend teams who want fast API iteration with less boilerplate. ## Why It Matters - **Performance**: Deploy APIs close to your frontend, reducing latency. - **Developer Experience**: Skip config files and custom server glue. Write standard Express code. - **Deployment**: No need to manage separate backend infra for small APIs. - **Fit**: Works best for Next.js or React apps that need simple backend logic or proxies. - **Who Should Care**: Frontend developers, DX owners, and those tracking performance or simplicity in deployment pipelines. ## Background Vercel’s new feature lets you run an Express backend out-of-the-box. Before this, you had to set up a custom server or use API routes (with their own handler signature). Now, you can write a plain Express app and deploy it directly. Previously:

> Note (replace me): Add a 2–3 line example from your own work or a small repo link.

- You had to wrap your logic in Vercel API handlers (`req`, `res` objects). - Custom servers required extra build steps and config. Now:
- Drop an `express.js` file into `/api` or `/api/` subfolders. - No explicit config needed—Vercel detects and launches your Express backend automatically. No breaking changes are listed. Existing API routes continue to work. Migration is optional if you want to use Express features. ## Minimal Example: Running Express on Vercel Create `/api/express.js` in your Next.js or React project root: ```js
// /api/express.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express on Vercel!' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy to Vercel. Visit `/api/express/hello`. You’ll see: ```json
{ "message": "Hello from Express on Vercel!" }
``` No `vercel.json` or special flags required. Vercel auto-detects the Express export and runs it as a backend handler. ### Flow Diagram Idea (Mermaid) ```mermaid

    User[User Request] -->|/api/express/hello| Vercel[Vercel Routing];

    ExpressApp -->|Handles route| Response[JSON Response];
``` ## Steps to Use Zero-Config Express on Vercel
1. Add `express` to your project dependencies: `npm install express`
2. Create an API file (e.g., `/api/express.js`) exporting an Express app instance. 3. Deploy to Vercel as usual (`git push`, or use the CLI). 4. Hit your route (e.g., `/api/express/hello`). 5. No extra config or flags needed unless customizing. ## Key API Usage Example (End-to-End)
Suppose you want a POST endpoint that echoes data:
```js
// /api/echo.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.post('/echo', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ received: req.body });
});
module.exports = app;
```
curl example:
curl -X POST https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/echo/echo -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"foo":"bar"}'
yields:
```json
{"received":{"foo":"bar"}}
```
## Pitfalls. Edge Cases


*What does this change for a small app you can ship today?*
- **Misconfigurations**: Don’t export functions or objects; must export an Express app instance (`module.exports = app`). - **Routing**: All routes are prefixed by the file path (`/api/express`), so `/hello` becomes `/api/express/hello`. - **SSR, Edge, Static**: Not documented yet whether these endpoints can run at the Edge or only as Node serverless functions. - **Performance**: Large middleware stacks may increase cold start time—test before shipping critical endpoints. - **Middleware Compatibility**: Some advanced Node modules may not work in serverless runtime; check compatibility if using native extensions. ## Checklist Before Shipping Zero-Config Express Backends on Vercel
1. Measure before-and-after latency using Web Vitals or custom metrics. 2. Ship a tiny demo page that calls your new endpoint end-to-end. 3. Add monitoring and alerting for errors and slow responses. 4. Plan a rollback path—keep old API routes until you’re confident in migration. 5. Share findings internally so others can avoid common mistakes.
