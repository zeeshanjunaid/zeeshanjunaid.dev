Vercel now lets you deploy Express.js backends without any extra configuration. You don’t need a `server.js` file, custom build steps, or special routing rules. Just add an Express handler—Vercel handles the rest ([source](https://vercel.com/changelog/zero-configuration-express-backends)). Why it matters: this removes setup steps for simple APIs. React and Next.js teams can add dynamic endpoints with familiar Express syntax. No need to eject from the Vercel workflow or maintain a separate backend. ## Why It Matters - **Performance:** No cold starts for most requests. Vercel optimizes deployment and caching automatically. - **Developer Experience:** Write API logic in Express, skip boilerplate config. - **Deployment:** No custom server required. Works with Vercel’s existing Git-based deploys. - **Typical Usage:** Add `/api` endpoints in Next.js or React projects for server-side logic, auth, or data fetching. - **Who should act:** Frontend engineers, DX leads, performance owners who want to simplify API routes. ## Background **What’s new:**

> Note (replace me): Add a 2–3 line example from your own work or a small repo link.

- Deploy Express handlers as API endpoints with zero config on Vercel. - Supported out of the box for new and existing projects. **Previous approach:**
- Needed a custom server (`server.js`) or additional config files. - Had to manage routing and middleware manually. - Could break static optimization in Next.js apps. **Migration/breaking changes:**
- No breaking changes documented yet ([source](https://vercel.com/changelog/zero-configuration-express-backends)). - Existing `api` routes continue to work. You can incrementally adopt Express handlers. ## Minimal Starter Example Add an Express handler in your `/api` directory: ```js title="/api/hello.js"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy to Vercel as usual. No extra config needed. ### End-to-end Example: Custom Middleware and Routing ```js title="/api/user.js"
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Example middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers['x-demo']) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Missing demo header' });
  }
  next();
});

app.get('/api/user', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ name: 'Ada Lovelace', id: 1 });
});

module.exports = app;
``` This route checks for a header before responding. It uses standard Express middleware and routing patterns. Deploying this file creates an endpoint at `/api/user` on your Vercel deployment. ## Setup Steps & Flags No flags or additional configuration are required ([source](https://vercel.com/changelog/zero-configuration-express-backends)). Place your Express handler in the `/api` directory. Deploy as normal with `vercel` CLI or Git integration. ## Diagram Idea: Request Flow (Mermaid) ```mermaid
graph TD;
    Client -->|HTTP Request| VercelEdge;
    VercelEdge -->|Route /api/*| ExpressHandler;
    ExpressHandler -->|Response| Client;
``` ## Pitfalls & Edge Cases - **Misconfigurations:** Don’t mix old-style function exports and Express handlers in the same file. Each `/api/*.js` should export either a function or an Express app—not both. - **SSR/Edge/Static quirks:** Not documented yet if these endpoints run on Edge or Node runtimes by default. Check deployment logs if unsure. - **Performance regressions:** If you add heavy middleware or blocking code, you may see slower responses compared to lightweight function handlers. - **Middleware order:** Standard Express rules apply—middleware order affects request handling. - **Unsupported features:** Not documented yet if all advanced Express features (like streaming) are supported out of the box. ## Checklist Before Shipping Zero-config Express APIs on Vercel 1. Measure before and after using Web Vitals or custom metrics for your API endpoints. 2. Ship a small demo page that calls your new Express endpoint to verify end-to-end wiring. 3. Add monitoring and alerting for your new backend routes (use Vercel Analytics or external tools). 4. Plan a rollback path—keep previous function-based routes until you’ve validated the migration. 5. Share findings internally so others know about the new pattern and any caveats you hit.
