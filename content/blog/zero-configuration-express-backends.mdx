Vercel now lets you deploy Express.js backends without any configuration. Drop an `express.js` file in your `/api` directory, and it runs as a serverless function. No `vercel.json`, no custom build scripts, no manual routing. This matters for teams building with React or Next.js. You can prototype or ship production APIs using familiar Express syntax. No need to learn new frameworks or glue code for simple endpoints. ## Why it matters - **Performance:** Serverless deploys scale automatically. Cold starts are handled by Vercel's infra. - **Developer Experience:** No boilerplate or config. Use standard Express middleware and patterns. - **Deployment:** Every push triggers a deploy preview. No separate backend pipeline needed. - **Stack fit:** Works with Next.js, React, and static sites. You keep everything in one repo. - **Who should care:** Frontend devs adding APIs, DX owners simplifying stacks, perf champions tracking cold starts. ## Background You can now add an `express.js` file to `/api` in your Vercel project. Vercel detects the file and runs it as a serverless backend using Express. **Before:**

> Note (replace me): Add a 2–3 line example from your own work or a small repo link.

- You wrote API handlers as single functions (`req`, `res`) in `/api`. - For custom routing or middleware, you used frameworks like Next.js API routes or rewrote logic in vanilla Node.js. - Extra config (e.g., `vercel.json`) was needed for non-trivial setups. **Now:**
- Write a full Express app in `/api/express.js`. - No extra config required. - Standard Express middleware works out of the box. No breaking changes are mentioned. Existing API routes still work. You can mix and match function files and Express backends in `/api`. ## Minimal Example: Add an Express Backend Create `/api/express.js`: ```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

app.post('/echo', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ youSent: req.body });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy to Vercel. Visit `/api/express/hello` to see the response:
```json
{ "message": "Hello from Express!" }
```
Send a POST request to `/api/express/echo` with JSON body:
```json
{ "foo": "bar" }
```
yields:
```json
{ "youSent": { "foo": "bar" } }
```
No flags or config needed—Vercel auto-detects the file. wires up the handler. ## How It Works (Flow Diagram) ```mermaid

    B --> C[Wraps as serverless function]
    C --> D[Routes /api/express/* requests]
    D --> E[Express middleware runs]
    E --> F[Response sent]
``` ## Key API Usage: End-to-End Example Suppose your Next.js app needs a custom login endpoint with session cookies. body parsing: Create `/api/express.js`:
```js
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cookieParser());
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.body;
  if (!username) return res.status(400).send('Missing username');
  res.cookie('session', 'fake-session-token');
  res.json({ ok: true });
});
module.exports = app;
```
you can now POST to `/api/express/login` from your frontend code. Standard Express middleware works—no extra glue code needed. ## Pitfalls & Edge Cases - **Misconfigurations:** Don’t name files incorrectly; only `/api/express.js` is auto-detected (not documented if subdirectories work). - **SSR/Edge Quirks:** Not documented if these handlers run at the edge or only as serverless functions. - **Static Exports:** Static-only sites won’t run Express backends—needs dynamic/serverless support enabled. - **Performance:** Monitor cold start times; heavy middleware may slow first request after deploy or scale-up. - **API Route Conflicts:** If you have both `/api/hello.js` and an Express route for `/hello`, behavior isn't documented yet—test locally before shipping. ## Checklist Before Shipping Zero-Config Express Backends on Vercel
1. Measure Web Vitals before and after enabling Express backend. 2. Ship a minimal demo page that calls your new API endpoint(s). 3. Add monitoring and alerting for errors and latency on new endpoints. 4. Plan a rollback path to previous API routes if issues appear. 5. Share findings with your team so others know about new patterns and pitfalls.
