Vercel now supports zero-configuration Express backends. You can deploy an Express API with no extra config. This change lets React and Next.js teams ship server logic fast, using familiar Express patterns. What changed: Vercel auto-detects `express` in your backend code. It sets up the runtime, routing, and deployment. No need for a custom server file, manual build steps, or `.vercelignore` tweaks ([source](https://vercel.com/changelog/zero-configuration-express-backends)). Why it matters:
- **Performance**: You can colocate backend logic with frontend code. This reduces cold starts and network hops. - **DX**: No config files or boilerplate needed. Write an `express` handler, push to Git, deploy. - **Deployment**: Works out of the box on Vercel’s serverless infra. No Dockerfiles or custom scripts. - **Fit**: Useful for small APIs, SSR helpers, webhooks, or prototyping inside Next.js/React stacks. - **Who should act**: Frontend devs who need server logic. DX owners aiming to cut setup time. Perf champions looking to reduce latency between UI and API. Background
---
Vercel’s new feature means you can drop an `express` app into your repo. The platform detects it and handles everything else. Before this, you had to use custom servers (unsupported in Next.js), write Vercel Functions by hand, or wire up build steps for backend code. Now, you skip all that. There are no breaking changes for existing Next.js/React projects unless you were relying on custom servers (which remain unsupported). Migration isn’t needed—just add an Express handler where you want API logic. Minimal Example
---
Suppose you want a `/api/hello` endpoint that returns JSON. Create a file at `api/hello.js`: ```js
// api/hello.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Push this to a Vercel-connected repo. That’s it—no `vercel.json`, no build config. Deploy and hit `/api/hello`. Vercel recognizes the Express export and runs your handler as a serverless function ([source](https://vercel.com/changelog/zero-configuration-express-backends)). How does it work? ---
Vercel scans for files exporting an Express app (via `module.exports`). When found, it sets up the runtime automatically:
- Detects usage of Express in `/api/*` files. - Wraps your handler in its serverless infra. - Handles routing and HTTP method matching. - No need to call `app.listen()`—Vercel manages the lifecycle. No extra flags or settings needed. Just use Express as usual. End-to-end Example: Authenticated Route
---
Here’s a full example for a protected endpoint: ```js
// api/user-profile.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Simple auth middleware example
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers['x-api-key'] !== process.env.API_KEY) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ user: 'alice', plan: 'pro' });
});

module.exports = app;
``` Deploy this file to `api/user-profile.js`. Hit `/api/user-profile` with the right header (`x-api-key`). You’ll get a JSON response if authorized. Diagram Idea (Mermaid)

``` Pitfalls & Edge Cases
---
- Don’t call `app.listen()`. Vercel manages the HTTP server lifecycle for you. - Only works in `/api/*` files (not documented for other folders). - SSR/Edge Middleware: This feature is for API routes only—not SSR pages or Edge functions ([source](https://vercel.com/changelog/zero-configuration-express-backends)). - Performance: Each API route runs as its own serverless function. Heavy initialization code can slow cold starts. - Not documented yet: How this interacts with Next.js middleware or advanced routing features. Checklist before rollout:
---
1. Measure before/after latency using Web Vitals or custom metrics. 2. Ship a demo page that calls your new Express endpoint. 3. Add monitoring and alerting for all new `/api/*` routes. 4. Plan how to roll back to previous function handlers if needed. 5. Share findings with your team—note any quirks or edge cases you hit.
