ServerlessHorrors.com catalogs real outages and incidents from teams using serverless platforms.

These stories show what can go wrong with serverless in production.

The site is a warning sign for React and Next.js engineers who trust serverless for APIs, SSR, or static hosting. ![Serverless horror illustration](/images/blog/serverless-horrors/cover.jpg) Serverless promises fast deploys and low ops burden.

But the stories on Serverless Horrors reveal hidden costs: cold starts, scaling failures, vendor limits, lock-in, and debugging nightmares.

These failures impact performance, developer experience (DX), and reliability—key concerns for frontend teams shipping at scale. ## Why It Matters React and Next.js teams often use serverless for API routes, SSR, or edge rendering.

> Note (replace me): Add a 2–3 line example from your own work or a small repo link.

Failures in these layers mean slow pages, broken sessions, or total outages. DX owners and performance leads need to understand these risks.

If your stack relies on Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda, or similar, these stories apply directly.

Serverless fits well for small APIs or static sites. But at scale—or with dynamic SSR—problems multiply.

Cold starts can add seconds to TTFB.

Vendor limits (timeouts, memory) can kill requests mid-flight. Debugging is harder when functions run in black boxes.

Frontend devs should care because a slow or broken API means a slow or broken UI.

Perf champions should measure the real impact of cold starts and scaling events on Web Vitals. ## Background: What Is Serverless Horrors?

ServerlessHorrors.com is a curated collection of postmortems and incident reports from real companies using serverless in production.

Each entry describes what broke, why it broke, and how teams responded. This isn't a new serverless platform or tool.

It's a knowledge base of failure cases.

Before this resource, most teams learned these lessons the hard way—after an outage. There's no migration needed to use Serverless Horrors.

But reading it may change your approach to deployment, monitoring, and fallback planning. ## Minimal Example: Serverless Function with Cold Start Trap Here's an end-to-end example that shows a classic pitfall: cold starts causing slow responses for the first user after deploy or scale-up.

Suppose you have a Next.js API route deployed as a serverless function: ```javascript
// /pages/api/hello.js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const start = Date.now();
  // Simulate heavy module import on cold start
  if (!global._heavy) {
    global._heavy = await import('crypto');
  }
  const elapsed = Date.now() - start;
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello', coldStartMs: elapsed });
}

``` Deploy this route to Vercel or AWS Lambda.

On first request after deploy (or after idle), `coldStartMs` will be much higher than on warm invocations. ## How To Monitor This Case (Manual Test) 1.

Deploy the route above. 2.

Wait until the function scales down (idle). 3.

Hit `/api/hello` and check `coldStartMs` in the response. 4.

Hit again; see if it's lower. 5.

Set up logging to track spikes in cold start times. ## Mermaid Flow Diagram Idea: Cold Start Impact on Request Path ```mermaid

``` ## Pitfalls From Serverless Horrors (Summarized) - **Misconfigurations:** Wrong memory settings cause timeouts or OOM kills; missing env vars crash functions at runtime. - **SSR/Edge Quirks:** Caching bugs or region mismatches break SSR; edge functions may lack Node APIs you expect. - **Performance Regressions:** Sudden cold starts spike TTFB; scaling limits throttle traffic under load; logs are delayed or missing during incidents. - **Debugging Gaps:** Stack traces are incomplete; reproducing bugs locally is hard due to cloud-only behavior. - **Vendor Lock-In:** Moving between providers is painful if you rely on proprietary features or APIs. ## Checklist For React/Next.js Teams Using Serverless - Measure before/after Web Vitals (TTFB, FCP) when deploying serverless routes. - Ship a minimal demo page that exercises all critical API/server-rendered paths under load. - Add monitoring and alerting for cold start latency spikes and error rates. - Plan a rollback path (static fallback or alternate infra) for major outages. - Share learnings from incidents internally so new hires don't repeat mistakes.
