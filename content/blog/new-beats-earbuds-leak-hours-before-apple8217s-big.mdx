Apple teased the upcoming Powerbeats Fit last month, and now renders and specifications for the sporty wireless earbuds have appeared online that give us a closer look at what to expect. According to trusted leaker Evan Blass, the new Beats earbuds will be available in four colorways — orange, gray, black, and pink — and provide up to 30 hours of battery life, or “7 hours per bud on one charge” without popping them back in the charging case.
The images of the Powerbeats Fit shared by Blass look similar to the $200 Beats Fit Pro earbuds that Apple launched in 2021, and they have several features in common. Both are powered by Apple’s H1 chip, have the same reported battery life, carry an IPX4 resistance to water splashes and sweat, and include a transparency mode and active noise cancellation. Leaks suggest that the Powerbeats Fit provides four ear customizable ear tip sizes instead of three, however.




The leaks don’t provide any information about price, wireless charging support, or case size. Apple is expected to announce some fitness-related upgrades for the AirPods Pro at today’s iPhone 17 event, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, so it would be odd for the Cupertino company to launch the Powerbeats Fit during the same show. The trailer that Apple released in August does say the new Beats will arrive in “Fall 2025” though, so we’ll have to wait and see."
