Serverless Horrors catalogs production failures in serverless stacks.

Each entry shows how small mistakes or cloud quirks can break apps at scale. ![Serverless horror illustration](/images/blog/serverless-horrors/cover.jpg) These stories matter for React and Next.js teams.

Many modern sites use serverless for API routes, SSR, or static builds.

When things go wrong, the impact is real—slow pages, broken deploys, or lost data. ## Why It Matters Serverless fits into most Next.js/React stacks as the default runtime for API routes and SSR.

Teams pick it for easy scaling and fast deploys. But the real world is messy.

Serverless functions can hit cold starts, run out of memory, or fail silently.

Frontend devs, DX owners, and performance leads should care.

If your team ships on Vercel, AWS Lambda, or Netlify Functions, these horror stories could happen to you. ## Background: What Is Serverless Horrors? [Serverless Horrors](https://serverlesshorrors.com/) is a collection of real incidents from teams using serverless platforms.

Each entry explains what broke and why. You get stack traces, root causes, and sometimes fixes.

This is different from official docs or happy-path tutorials.

It shows what happens when theory meets production traffic.

There's no migration guide or breaking change list—just hard lessons learned by others. ## Minimal Example: Serverless Gone Wrong in Next.js Suppose you add a simple API route in `pages/api/hello.js`: ```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'world' });
}

``` It works locally.

But on Vercel (or AWS Lambda), you might see random cold starts or timeouts under load. To repro a cold start issue: 1.

Deploy this route to Vercel (default settings). 2.

Hit the endpoint after several minutes of inactivity. 3.

Notice the first request is much slower than later ones.

There's no config flag to fix cold starts—they're part of serverless tradeoffs. ## End-to-End Example: Logging a Failing Request Add logging to spot failures: ```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    // Simulate a crash on purpose if query 'fail' is set
    if (req.query.fail === '1') {
      throw new Error('Simulated serverless error');
    }
    res.status(200).json({ name: 'world' });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('API error:', err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
  }
}

``` Deploy this code.

Call `/api/hello?fail=1` and check logs in your cloud dashboard.

You may see errors that don't surface in local dev. ## Mermaid Diagram Idea: Serverless Failure Flow ```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[User request] --> B[API Route / SSR]
  B --> C{Cold start?}
  C -- Yes --> D[Slow response]
  C -- No --> E[Normal response]
  D --> F{Resource limits?}
  F -- Exceeded --> G[Crash/Error]
  F -- OK --> E[Normal response]

``` ## Pitfalls To Watch For - **Misconfigurations**: Forgetting environment variables or secrets breaks prod but not local dev. - **Edge Cases**: SSR pages may fail if they depend on filesystem access not available in Lambda. - **Performance**: Cold starts can spike TTFB (time to first byte).

Memory leaks crash functions under load. - **Silent Failures**: Some platforms swallow errors unless you log them explicitly. - **Limits**: Hitting execution timeouts or payload limits causes dropped requests with little warning. ## Checklist Before Shipping Serverless Features - Measure before/after with Web Vitals (TTFB, LCP). - Ship a tiny demo page using your API route in production. - Add monitoring and alerting for all serverless endpoints. - Plan a rollback path if latency or errors spike after deploy. - Share learnings from incidents with your team—don't repeat others' mistakes.
