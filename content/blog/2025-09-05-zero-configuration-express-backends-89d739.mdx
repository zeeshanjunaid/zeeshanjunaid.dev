# Zero-configuration Express backends

## What changed: Zero-configuration Express backends

Vercel introduced zero-configuration Express backends. This means you can run Express apps on Vercel without extra setup. For React and Next.js teams, this simplifies backend integration. No more complex server configs or custom deployments. Just write your Express code and deploy.

## Why it matters

Express is a popular Node.js backend framework. Many React/Next.js apps use it for APIs or server logic. Before this change, deploying Express apps on Vercel needed manual config or workarounds.

Now, zero-config Express backends improve:

- **Performance:** Express runs optimized on Vercel's platform.
- **Developer Experience (DX):** Less setup means faster iteration.
- **Deployment:** One platform for frontend and backend.

This fits naturally in React/Next.js stacks. You can keep your frontend and backend code close. It suits frontend devs who want simple APIs, DX owners aiming for smooth workflows, and performance champions tracking app speed.

## Background

Vercel's zero-config Express backend feature lets you deploy Express apps without extra config files or custom server code. Previously, you had to wrap Express in serverless functions or configure custom servers.

Now, Vercel detects Express apps automatically. It handles routing and server setup behind the scenes. This reduces boilerplate and errors.

There are no breaking changes for existing Next.js apps. But if you migrate from custom Express setups, you should remove manual server configs to avoid conflicts.

## Steps to get started

### 1. Minimal example

Create a simple Express app in your project:

```js
// api/index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Express!' });
});

module.exports = app;
```

### 2. Enable zero-config (usually automatic)

Vercel detects Express apps by default. No flags or config needed. Just deploy your project.

If you have custom settings, check your `vercel.json` to avoid conflicts.

### 3. Use the API in your Next.js app

Fetch data from your Express backend like this:

```js
// pages/index.js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function Home() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/hello')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setMessage(data.message));
  }, []);

  return <div>{message}</div>;
}
```

This example shows a full round-trip from frontend to Express backend.

## Pitfalls to watch

- **Misconfigurations:** Avoid mixing custom Express servers with Next.js API routes. Let Vercel handle Express detection.
- **Edge cases:** Express runs as serverless functions on Vercel. Cold starts can affect SSR or Edge runtime performance.
- **Static exports:** Express backends donâ€™t run in static exports. Use server or serverless deployment.
- **Performance:** Monitor for latency spikes. Express adds overhead compared to pure serverless functions.

## Checklist before shipping

1. **Measure before/after:** Use Web Vitals to track frontend performance changes.
2. **Ship a tiny demo:** Deploy a minimal Express API to verify zero-config works.
3. **Add monitoring:** Set up alerts for API errors or latency.
4. **Plan rollback:** Keep previous deployment ready in case of issues.
5. **Share learnings:** Document your experience for your team.
