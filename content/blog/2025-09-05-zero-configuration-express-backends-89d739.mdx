# What changed: Zero-configuration Express backends

Vercel now supports Express backends with zero configuration. This means you can add an Express server to your Next.js app without extra setup. It’s a big deal for teams building modern React or Next.js apps who want backend APIs alongside their frontend, with less hassle.

# Why it matters

- **Performance and developer experience:** Express is a familiar Node.js framework. Zero-config means faster setup and fewer deployment headaches.
- **Fits well in React/Next.js stacks:** Many apps need custom APIs. This lets you add them without separate servers or complex configs.
- **Who should act:** Frontend developers, DX leads, and performance champions should explore this. It can speed up prototyping and simplify backend logic.

# Background

Vercel’s new feature lets you deploy Express apps directly on their platform without manual configuration. Before, you had to set up custom servers or use serverless functions with more boilerplate.

Now, your Express app runs out of the box. Vercel handles routing, deployment, and scaling.

**Breaking changes or migrations?** If you used custom Express setups before, you may want to migrate to zero-config to reduce complexity. The API is mostly compatible but some manual routing may change.

# Steps to get started

Here’s a minimal example:

```js
// api/index.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from zero-config Express!' });
});

module.exports = app;
```

### How to enable

- Place your Express app file inside the `/api` folder.
- No extra flags needed. Vercel detects it automatically.
- Deploy as usual with `vercel` CLI or Git integration.

### Key API usage

Express works as usual. You can add middleware, routes, and error handling.

End-to-end example:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  const received = req.body;
  res.json({ received, status: 'ok' });
});

module.exports = app;
```

This endpoint will handle JSON POST requests without extra config.

# Pitfalls to watch

- **Common misconfigurations:** Placing Express files outside `/api` folder means zero-config won’t detect them.
- **Edge cases:** Server-side rendering (SSR) and Edge functions are separate. Express runs as a Node.js server, so it won’t run on the Edge runtime.
- **Performance:** Express adds some overhead compared to pure serverless functions. Watch your cold starts and latency.

# Checklist before shipping

- Measure performance before and after using Web Vitals tools.
- Ship a small demo page that calls your Express API.
- Set up monitoring and alerting on your API endpoints.
- Have a rollback plan in case of issues.
- Share your learnings with your team to improve DX.
