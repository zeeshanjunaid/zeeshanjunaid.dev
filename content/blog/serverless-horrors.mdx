![]( /images/blog/serverless-horrors/cover.jpg ) ServerlessHorrors.com collects real-world failures from teams using serverless platforms.

These stories show how serverless can break in production.

If you use React or Next.js with serverless, review these cases before shipping.

Serverless promises zero ops and easy scaling. In practice, it can introduce new risks: cold starts, timeouts, vendor lock-in, and debugging headaches.

These issues hit frontend teams when deploying SSR or API routes on platforms like Vercel or AWS Lambda. ## Why It Matters for React/Next.js Serverless is popular for Next.js apps—especially for SSR, API routes, or edge deployments.

But performance can degrade if you hit cold starts or platform limits. Developer experience (DX) suffers when debugging slow requests or mysterious errors.

Frontend devs, DX owners, and perf champions should understand these risks.

Serverless failures often surface as slow pages, broken APIs, or flaky builds.

These impact users directly. ## What Is Serverless Horrors? [ServerlessHorrors.com](https://serverlesshorrors.com/) is a public collection of serverless outages and postmortems.

Each entry describes what failed, why it failed, and how teams fixed it (if possible). The site covers all major providers: AWS Lambda, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Workers.

Previously, most teams learned about these issues only after an incident.

Now you can study patterns in advance: cold starts causing missed SLAs, subtle provider limits breaking builds, or SSR requests timing out under load. There are no breaking changes or migrations required to use the resource itself.

But the stories may prompt you to review your deployment setup. ## Minimal Example: SSR Route on Serverless Here's a minimal Next.js API route that runs on serverless: ```
ts
// pages/api/hello.ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Serverless' });
}
``` To deploy this on Vercel (default serverless target): ```
bash
vercel --prod
``` This works for small APIs.

But if your endpoint needs a database connection or heavy computation, expect cold starts and possible timeouts. ## Flow Diagram Idea: Serverless Request Path in Next.js ```

graph TD;
  User[User Request] --> CDN[CDN/Edge Node];

  CDN --> User;
``` ## Common Pitfalls from Serverless Horrors - **Misconfigurations:** Environment variables missing in production; secrets exposed by accident; wrong memory/timeout settings. - **SSR/Edge Quirks:** Cold starts delay first request; edge functions sometimes lack required Node APIs; caching headers misapplied. - **Performance Regressions:** Uncached SSR pages cause slow TTFB; API endpoints hit provider concurrency limits; builds fail due to ephemeral storage limits. - **Debugging Pain:** Logs scattered across regions; stack traces truncated; difficult to reproduce issues locally. - **Vendor Lock-In:** Workarounds for one platform don't transfer to others.

Hard to migrate away after launch. ## Checklist Before Deploying React/Next.js to Serverless 1.

Measure before and after with Web Vitals (TTFB, LCP). 2.

Ship a tiny demo page using your actual stack and monitor real traffic. 3.

Add monitoring and alerting (errors, latency spikes). 4.

Plan a rollback path (can you redeploy to static or non-serverless target?). 5.

Share learnings internally—postmortems help others avoid repeat mistakes. ## Unknowns / Not Documented Yet
- Some platform-specific failure modes aren't fully documented yet on ServerlessHorrors.com. - No automated tool exists yet to scan your codebase for these risks. - It's not clear how often each failure happens in production across all users. - No migration guides are provided—just incident reports and summaries. - No official recommendations from framework authors are listed yet.
